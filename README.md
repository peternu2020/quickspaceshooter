EECS 376 - Quick SpaceShooter Game

A custom 2D game I created in Unity using C#. - Peter

Your mission is simple. You are an interceptor-class gunship pursuing two enemy reconnaissance drones. Your armor is versatile enough to sustain prolonged damage, but your main blaster has been damaged and one hit will render it useless and fail the mission.

 Your ship’s flight system will keep you at a safe, fixed distance from the enemy drones. You will still be able to maintain control of your ship’s movements along the left and right strafes by pressing the left and right keys. Fire at will by pressing the space bar.  Keep in mind that your blaster is not fully operational and will take a few microseconds to reload after each shot. 

The enemy drones have light armor that will be destroyed in one hit but they will also move very fast. Time your shots carefully and keep moving to avoid getting hit. Your score will update upon each drone kill and your mission will be completed successfully upon elimination of both drones. Remember, if your ship gets hit you will survive but your blaster will be destroyed and the mission will fail. 

Our intelligence has also suggested that our enemy has acquired and reverse-engineered our advanced missile capabilities. This means that missiles from the enemy drones may be set to detonate as soon as they reach your ship’s proximity. The explosion will damage your ship’s cannon. We suggest you keep your ship oscar mike and minimize being in the enemy drones’ line of sight as much as possible.
